# MCMetal

MCMetal is a Fabric-based macOS renderer backend project that replaces Minecraft's OpenGL rendering path with Apple Metal while preserving vanilla gameplay behavior.

Native implementation note: the native layer is Swift-first for Cocoa/Metal integration, exposed to Java through a stable C/JNI surface.
